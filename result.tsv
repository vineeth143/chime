how heavy	assuming that you 're asking `` what motor should i get ? `` , i have to say `` that depends on what you want it to do '' . just as you ca n't expect a car like a geo-metro to go from 0-60 in 5 seconds  but rather would need a corvette for such ) , getting a motor in the $ 90-150 range that can only provide 18-25 lbs thrust will move you on a lake fine , but be somewhat slow . the advantage of the cheaper/smaller motor is that it uses less power , so you can have a smaller battery and/or it will last longer . if you want one that can handle a rivers current or move you faster , you may need one with 30-40 lbs thrust range that will cost ~ $ 175-250 . going bigger than that is probably not a good idea since this boat manual says `` max motor weight ~20 lbs '' and even the 40 lbs thrust model will likely be 25lbs weight  or at least that 's what mine is ) . if you want to know about name brands , look at reviews to see if there 's lots of `` poor quality '' ones or such , otherwise many will do a fine job .	i'm not sure about the weight of the knife but it is very heavy and very heavy in my opinion.

can the brim on this hat be shaped so that the front and back slope downwards?	hello ryan , the ontario rat ii with the black handle comes in two blade styles . a satin finish  ok8860 ) and the black finish  ok88601 ) . the geometry of the blade is less important on how it holds an edge than what kind of steel it is made of . they are both made of aus 8 steel . the aus series stainless steel contains vanadium , unlike the 440 series steel , which increases its wear resistance and edge retention . the vanadium allows a sharper edge to be put on the blade . the hardness of the steel in the rat ii is hrc 55-56. i believe the description on amazon is wrong . it says the hardness is 58-60. there is a tradeoff  inverse proportion ) between hardness and toughness . the harder a blade is , the more brittle  less tough ) it will be . a hard blade will hold an edge longer , but will be more susceptible to breaking . a blade with an rc hardness less than 52 is considered soft . a blade with an rc hardness greater than 60 is considered very hard  brittle ) . so the rat ii with a hardness of rc 56-58 is a good mix of toughness and edge retention . you can checkout my article on knife blade steel at www.glenscampingtips.com/ ? page_id=42 . the clip is pretty standard as far as folders with clips . i believe it sticks out about an eighth of an inch . thanks , glen from campingstuff	yes, it's a very nice hat and the front is very comfortable for me to wear in my daily life

how dose it attach to 590	1. you can use the standard bolt on a mosin nagant , because this mount replaces the front leaf sight after it 's removed . 2. i used a ncstar long eye relief 2-7x32 . it is not great glass but it is good enough for what the rifle is worth . it 's about $ 50 and makes shooting steel at 250yds cake . url do n't spend $ 200+ on optics for a $ 100 rifle . it does n't make sense to upsell a beater .	i'm not sure if it will attach to the other side of my rifle

does it help strengthen the hand for guitar practice?	yes it would . i just bought this bike the 270 model like 2 months ago . my weight is 350lbs i am 6ft tall and the bike handles me with no problems does n't even move to the sides . i bought this product with confidence because from past experience i know gym equipment no matter how cheap or expensive they are built past there weight capacity . i have used eliptical machines with weight capacity of 220 on those you stand and they have not broken . i have also had various gym memberships and small gyms have some equipment that does not look big people friendly but i have used it with confidence and they work fine . i would recommend this for gym use , like i said user max is 300 but i am 350 and use it fine , i would think this could hold someone up to 420lbs . worst case scenario the seat brackets would become lose upon sitting not enough damage for someone to fall off . i hope this helps you . *update* sorry i wrote this quickly before rushing to work . but i have now corrected my spelling and would like to add more details to my answer . as i said , this bike would be perfect for gym use . i would highly recommend you go with the 270 model for a few reasons . reasons : 1. the seat on this 270 model is thickly padded and wide . keep in mind it is for use of most likely overweight people like myself , comfort is a must to keep members happy . 2. the foot pedals on this model are 3-crank pedal . meaning it is more durable for long hours of heavy use . 3. the seat is mounted on a aluminum sliding rail , this makes it easier to slide the seat into different position quickly compared to the other model  230 ) as to where you have to use a pin bolt to move the seat . 4. lastly let 's talk about the price . right now amazon has it on special at $ 423.69 , regular price on amazon is $ 499 which is how much i paid for it i did n't want to wait for a deal any longer . the 230 model regular price is $ 399 right now it is $ 377 . so by a difference of like $ 40 dollars you get the thick padded seat , the easy adjustable sliding seat . and most importantly better durable foot pedals . this would be the best choice for your gym over the other models . i would take advantage of this awesome deal amazon has on this bike right now , who knows how much longer it will be at this special price . some other quick details about this bike . some people say the fan it has is not good enough , but in my opinion the fan is great it gets the job done you ca n't expect a industrial fan breeze out of the size of a fan this small but it is great . besides i would expect air condition or ceiling fans at a gym . this bike has a usb charging port so it is great for charging your cell phone or like a tablet  any usb chargeable device ) . the bike has many different workout programs . the bike also has 25 levels of resistance  how intense the foot pedals are depending on how much you want to challenge yourself in a workout session ) . i personally only use up to resistance 12 right now and it really feels like a good workout , so there is still plenty of room to work your way up through the different intensity levels . plus it has free shipping , my bike arrived in great condition box was not dented at all . hope this helps you .	yes, it does, but you will need to use a lot of strength to practice the guitar and you will need a lot less than the original one you bought for guitars

the bolts i use for my xbow are 22inch 9/32. would these broadheads fit that size bolt?	i 've never had the laser at the range , i bought the green spectrum for daylight visibility and that found that even in the shade on a sunny day it was hard to pick up at 15 feet . i like the design mimicking the one that the military uses that but ca n't be acquired by the public . the ncstar laser that switches from red to green produces about 40 % more output in the green spectrum and is clearly visible at 25 yards in full sunlight and that 's what i was looking for . to answer a couple of your other questions the unit is made of solid aluminum and the knobs have a nice clean positive click and make it easy to adjust however i found that mounting it to a weaver style rail was a bit of a problem because the mounting screw is a little on the short side . i mounted this on a m4 weapons platform anyway and i can zero to with the aimpoint comp2 already on the weapon . it is visible on an overcast day and at night , when i get time i will probably take it to the range and sight it in but it is n't high on my priority list , so i ca n't ask your question if it holds zero but i do n't know why it would n't . i have to say though the people at sightmark service apartment were very accommodating and sent me a second one that they tested but still did n't have enough output to be seen in full sunlight . another point is if you attached the remote pressure switch which is a 3.5 mm plug the unit is no longer waterproof . but what do you expect for $ 89 , the military plays in excess of $ 500 for their laser designated sights on their weapons platforms . i am a retired weapons , sgt . and none of this technology existed when i was in the service so i thought i 'd give it a try like the aimpoint and if one of the real laser designated were to ever make their way in the hands of civilian someone would land in leavenworth . if one of those was available i would 've bought it . i do however have a blog and rate all the new ultrahigh tech flashlights that are being produced and have lights on all my tactical weapons platforms . i hope this helps you out a little bit .	i don't think they would fit the 22inch 9/1032 bolts but

does this use the olympic bar? the 45 pound one	no ! these are not `` small-base '' dies . they are factory spec dies . it is unfortunate that so many people give out misinformation . small base dies shrink base circumference down 4/1000 '' below saami specs for easier chambering at the expense of working the brass harder than needed . they expand again when fired and will be again shrunk when run through a `` small-base die '' . the small base was popular back in the day , when reloaders thought it was useful , but with newer technology and newer precision in chamber manufacturing and new information found that it is unnecessary and damaging to brass unless needed for full auto purposes . to my knowledge hornady does not sell `` small base '' dies . small based dies will be clearly marked `` sb '' in the serial code. `` the small base die set is intended for use for ammunition to be used in auto , semi-auto , and lever action rifles so that the loaded round chambers and extracts easily . the small base sizer die sizes the case from the shoulder to the head of the case a couple of thousandths smaller than a full length sizer die . in certain calibers it also sets the shoulder of the case back a thousandth or two more than the full length sizer die . '' use a die that is in close agreement with your chamber and your brass will last an infinite number of reloadings . use a factory spec die unless you really have a special need for `` small-base '' sizing like using machine-gun fired brass .	yes, it doesn't have the 45 pound bar as well as a 45 pound bar that is designed to be used on an indoor bench and not as an outdoor bench for that matter.

how big / heavy can you be to use this machine?	lumens are difficult to calculate , since it varies with distance and depends on the actual size and focus of the light . i can tell you that on a fresh pair of batteries , it can light up an average room quite well . it 's about as bright as a small surefire flashlight , or a large incandescent maglight .	i'm 6'5 and it is very comfortable for me to be able to use it

does anyone know what year this helmet was made? apparently giro claims a 3 year expiration date and i would want to only get a 2014 model.	hi keith , i got the locking carrier and thought it to be a great piece . i have a ford escape hybrid , and unfortunately , while the carrier can adjust to fit larger width boards  my sup is 31.5x 3 or 4 in thick ) , it must be placed inside the runners on the cross bars . each connection point from the carrier needs a few inches inside the running boards , meaning less room for my board in the space in between . unless you have cross bars without running bars that restrict the distance for separating them - i would def measure out the space  leaving about 3 inches on either side of the interior ) where you will attach the carrier . also - i had factory installed crossbars , which were kind of an oval shape . the carrier will fit to any share - but i did find that the bolts that came with the carrier once fully installed nearly touched the roof of my suv ... meaning scratches ! i was so sad to see such a great carrier not work for me . also - i believe it says you can stack boards - iwoul ; dnt recommend tho . int he end i just got some dakine board straps then used the crossbar pads that came with this system . was simple , secure  but not locking ) , and did the trick without any extra problems . ) my recommendation if you still try to get this carrier - measure it out with the space you have . for a 33 in . width - you 'll need about 40 inches between running boards to place the kit and your board . it comes with bolts ... but you may want to look into getting after market bolts .	i bought this helmet in 2014. it is made in 2014 so

how do you guys think this compares to the zero tolerance 0561? specifically in terms of hard use... i don't care about weight etc..	i do n't know , but i think there are better products to boil water on a fire . the stainless steel is pretty lightweight . the product description states it is made of 18/8 food grade stainless steel , which makes me think `` no '' since it does not state `` cooking grade . '' you should be able to research the grade on the internet and find out its heat tolerance . instructions state to not put hot liquids in it , but that may be to avoid burning one 's hand when holding since the cap is a screw on and there is no handle . if you were able to boil water , you would need a mitt to handle the hot kanteen . my kanteen rusted within a year of use ; i think using it to boil water would speed up that process .	i'm not sure about the zero tolerance but it is very hard to put in place for me to use it for long periods at least but if you are going on an extended trip from work or vacation or something like that then you should be fine with this knife

soooooooooooo............. how much does this really weigh????	the belt is exactly 2 inches wide . i just measured it myself . in case this is of interest to you or anyone else , i 'll mention that i used it for a holster and dual magazine holder that had 1.5 inch openings . although i proved it is possible , it was a complete struggle , wiggling and pulling and yanking and rocking back and forth in tiny increments that took forever . if i wanted to remove them and use the belt for something else , it would also be a struggle . i was determined to do it and i did . they will not budge which is cool because they do not slide around on the belt . this is fine with me as i have made this a setup that remains assembled . instead of having to take off your belt and then put these holsters on in between belt loops and stuff , you just grab the whole belt and quickly clip it on over your pants and belt  or underwear or pajamas in the middle of the night . ) if someone wanted to do this as a temporary thing , i do not recommend it . needless to say , this 2 inch belt is undoubtedly designed to be used with items with 2 inch openings or clips .	i'm not sure if it weighs more than 2.5 pounds or something like this and

steel , which increases its wear resistance and edge retention . the vanadium allows a sharper edge to be put on the blade . the hardness of the steel in the rat ii is hrc 55-56. i believe the description on amazon is wrong . it says the hardness is 58-60. there is a tradeoff  inverse proportion ) between hardness and toughness . the harder a blade is , the more brittle  less tough ) it

screw slots at all in the barrel expander pieces . in addition , it 's impossible to secure real `` dead center '' axial alignment between the cp 's theoretical beam and the central axis of the rifle's/pistol 's bore . the centerpoint 's body taper is much too rapid for it to be any use in .177 bores . with the failure of the cp , i bought the quarton vlm-634-18 low divergence/long range glass-lensed 5 vdc laser module  all brass , three beam alignment screws ) through amazon , and with the help of a good lathe and instruments typical to a model shop i made a real boresighter in one afternoon ... one that requires a specific 14 '' guide shaft to press-fit/twist into the bore of each rifle i am aligning . a licon surplus rocker switch cost thirty cents , and for power i used the transformer from my master chrony ballistic chronograph . the quarton laser alone may have cost me $ 50 , but having examined the rest of the boresighters available i came to understand that only a long guide rod that actually bites into the barrel 's rifling  slight interference fit needed ) will provide the anchor necessary for a tight-beam/small-spot laser to do a perfectly exact job ,

bike the 270 model like 2 months ago . my weight is 350lbs i am 6ft tall and the bike handles me with no problems does n't even move to the sides . i bought this product with confidence because from past experience i know gym equipment no matter how cheap or expensive they are built past there weight capacity . i have used eliptical machines with weight capacity of 220 on those you stand and they have not broken . i have also had various gym memberships and small gyms have some equipment that does not look big people friendly but i have used it with confidence and they work fine . i would recommend this for gym use , like i said user max is 300 but i am 350 and use it fine , i would think this could hold someone up to 420lbs . worst case scenario the seat brackets would become lose upon sitting not enough damage for someone to fall off . i hope this helps you . *update* sorry i wrote this quickly before rushing to work . but i have now corrected my spelling and would like to add more details to my answer . as i said , this bike would be perfect for gym use . i would highly recommend you go with the 270 model for a few reasons . reasons : 1. the seat on this 270 model is thickly padded and wide . keep in mind it is for use of most likely overweight people like myself , comfort is a must to keep members happy . 2. the foot pedals on this model are 3-crank pedal . meaning it is more durable for long hours of heavy use . 3. the seat is mounted on a aluminum sliding rail , this makes it easier to slide the seat into different position quickly compared to the other model  230 ) as to where you have to use a pin bolt to move the seat . 4. lastly let 's talk about the price . right now amazon has it on special at $ 423.69 , regular price on amazon is $ 499 which is how much i paid for it i did n't want to wait for a deal any longer . the 230 model regular price is $ 399 right now it is $ 377 . so by a difference of like $ 40 dollars you get the thick padded seat , the easy adjustable sliding seat . and most importantly better durable foot pedals . this would be the best choice for your gym over the other models . i would take advantage of this awesome deal amazon has on this bike right now , who knows how much longer it will be at this special price . some other quick details about this bike . some people say the fan it has is not good enough , but in my opinion the fan is great it gets the job done you ca n't expect a industrial fan breeze out of the size of a fan this small but it is great . besides i would expect air condition or ceiling fans at a gym . this bike has a usb charging port so it is great for charging your cell phone or like a tablet  any usb chargeable device ) . the bike has many different workout programs . the bike also has 25 levels of resistance  how intense the foot pedals are depending on how much you want to challenge yourself in a workout session ) . i personally only use up to resistance 12 right now

switches from red to green produces about 40 % more output in the green spectrum and is clearly visible at 25 yards in full sunlight and that 's what i was looking for . to answer a couple of your other questions the unit is made of solid aluminum and the knobs have a nice clean positive click and make it easy to adjust however i found that mounting it to a weaver style rail was a bit of a problem because the mounting screw is a little on the short side . i mounted this on a m4 weapons platform anyway and i can zero to with the aimpoint comp2 already on the weapon . it is visible on an overcast day and at night , when i get time i will probably take it to the range and sight it in but it is n't high on my priority list , so i ca n't ask your question if it holds zero but i do n't know why it would n't . i have to say though the people at sightmark service apartment were very accommodating and sent me a second one that they tested but still did n't have enough output to be seen

of $ 500 for their laser designated sights on their weapons platforms . i am a retired weapons , sgt . and none of this technology existed when i was in the service so i thought i 'd give it a try

anyone know what year this helmet was made? apparently giro claims a 3 year expiration date and i would want to only get a 2014 model.", "answers": ["hi keith , i got the locking carrier and thought it to be a great piece . i have a ford escape hybrid , and unfortunately , while the carrier can adjust to fit larger width boards  my sup is 31.5x 3 or 4 in thick ) , it must be placed inside the runners on the cross bars . each connection point from the carrier needs a few inches inside the running boards , meaning less room for my board in the space in between . unless you have cross bars without running bars that restrict the distance for separating them - i would def measure out the space  leaving about 3 inches on either side of the interior ) where you will attach the carrier . also - i had factory installed crossbars , which were kind of an oval shape . the carrier will fit to any share - but i did find that the bolts that came with the carrier once fully installed nearly touched the roof of my suv ... meaning scratches ! i was so sad to see such a great carrier not work for me . also - i believe it says you can stack boards - iwoul ; dnt recommend tho . int he end i just got some dakine board straps then used the crossbar pads that came with this system . was simple , secure  but not locking ) , and did the trick without any extra problems . ) my recommendation if you still try to get this carrier - measure it out with the space you have . for a 33 in . width - you 'll need about 40 inches between running boards to place the kit and your board . it comes with bolts ... but you may want to look into getting after market bolts ."], "prediction": "i bought this helmet in 2014. it is made in 2014 so"}, {"question": "will these grips fit my fx titan which
